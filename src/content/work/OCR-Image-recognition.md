  This repository provides scripts for extracting text from images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and managing invoice image data. It features two approaches:
  1. ocr_script: A pipeline using standard OCR libraries.
  2. easyocr_script: A pipeline leveraging the library for image-to-text extraction.

Image Recognition and OCR Tool
A Python-based tool to extract text from images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Built with both traditional OCR and EasyOCR techniques, this project demonstrates real-world applications such as:

Invoice parsing

Text extraction from scanned documents

Image-based data processing pipelines

Key Features:

Two pipelines: one using pytesseract and another using EasyOCR

Can handle both single and batch image input

Clean modular code for easy integration into other projects

Option to export recognized text
