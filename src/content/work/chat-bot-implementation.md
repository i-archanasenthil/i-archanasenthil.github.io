The GitHub repository [Alberta Wildfire Analysis and Chatbot](https://github.com/i-archanasenthil/alberta-wildfire-human-activity-classification-model) focuses on analyzing wildfire occurrences in Alberta, Canada, with an emphasis on understanding the role of human activity in fire ignition and developing classification models to distinguish between human-caused and natural wildfires.

The project encompasses several key tasks:

**Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Historical wildfire data from 2006 to 2024 was compiled, including attributes such as fire location, cause, and size. The data underwent cleaning and preprocessing to ensure quality and consistency.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** EDA was conducted to identify patterns and trends in wildfire occurrences, with a particular focus on the distribution of human-caused versus natural fires across different regions and time periods in Alberta.

**Feature Engineering:** Relevant features were engineered to enhance the predictive power of the models. This included transforming categorical variables, handling missing values, and selecting pertinent attributes that influence fire ignition causes.

**Model Development and Evaluation:** Classification models were developed to predict the cause of wildfires. Various machine learning algorithms were employed, and their performance was evaluated using appropriate metrics to determine their effectiveness in distinguishing between human-caused and natural fires.

**Visualization and Reporting:** The results of the analysis and modeling were visualized to provide intuitive insights into the factors influencing wildfire causes. A comprehensive report and presentation were prepared to summarize the findings and methodologies employed in the project [Medium](https://medium.com/@i.archanasenthil/exploring-wildfire-distribution-of-alberta-the-role-of-human-activity-and-fire-class-7476c21fd92a)

A distinctive and interactive component of the project is the inclusion of a **custom-built chatbot**, designed to provide users with an accessible and intuitive interface to interact with the wildfire dataset and predictive model. Built using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the chatbot allows users to ask questions or input wildfire-related parameters (such as month, region, or fire size), and it responds with information or predictions about the likely cause of a fire. This enhances the usability of the model, especially for non-technical users or stakeholders in wildfire management, by offering real-time feedback in plain language. The chatbot demonstrates the practical application of AI in public safety and environmental monitoring by translating complex analytical results into user-friendly dialogue. This feature also reflects the project's broader goal of integrating data science tools with decision-support systems for wildfire prevention and mitigation.
