This project aims to predict the critical temperature (Tc) at which materials become superconductorsâ€”an essential property in advanced technologies like MRI machines, maglev trains, and energy-efficient power grids. The approach involves statistical modeling, exploratory data analysis, and visualization, offering both scientific insight and practical tools for material science research.

**Key Components:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Preprocessing**

- Used a structured dataset containing elemental compositions and measured Tc values of various superconductors.

- Cleaned and transformed the dataset; log transformation was applied to the target variable to reduce skewness and stabilize variance.

- Encoded categorical features and standardized numerical data as needed for linear modeling.

**2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- Performed feature exploration and correlation analysis to identify significant predictors.

- Visualized feature distributions and relationships to understand potential linear associations with Tc.

**3.Model Development**

- Built a multivariate linear regression model to estimate the critical temperature from material features.

- The model was evaluated using standard performance metrics such as RÂ² and RMSE.

- Tested the six key assumptions of linear regression to validate the integrity of the model:

  - Linearity

  - Independence of errors

  - Homoscedasticity

  - Normality of residuals

  - No multicollinearity

  - No significant outliers or high leverage points

**4.Model Validation & Diagnostic Analysis**

- Residual plots, Q-Q plots, VIF (Variance Inflation Factor), and Durbin-Watson tests were used to confirm assumptions.

- This thorough diagnostic step ensures the reliability and interpretability of the regression model.

**5.Interactive Dashboard**

- Built with Dash, the dashboard enables users to interactively explore material features and predicted Tc values.

- Users can filter, visualize distributions, and examine how feature changes influence predictions.

This project demonstrates how machine learning and statistical rigor can be applied in physical sciences to predict material properties. It is especially valuable in research and development for discovering or optimizing new superconducting materials.
